# Gamecenter Client ++
This application facilitates game data retreival from the official Swiss volleyball association. It is streamlined and limited to the most common tasks:
* List upcoming games
* Show game locations on a map
* export game data to the calendar
* export a game data spreadsheet

You can find the application deployed at https://alexander.striffeler.ch/volley

Data is currently available for the region Bern-Solothurn only. Please create an issue if you wish to have the application enabled for other regions, too. Game data is updated nightly.

## Serve locally
To run the application on your local machine, run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will display sample data from the season 2019/2020.
